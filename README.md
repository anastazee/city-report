## City Report

This is our team's repo with our Flutter (using Dart) project for the 2023-2024 ECE NTUA class Αλληλεπίδραση Ανθρώπου - Υπολογιστή (Human-Computer Interaction).
The interface was designed following closely the Figma Prototypes we created for the project's second phase.
Storing the data, making queries on them and user authentication are performed via Firebase.

Feel free to explore the `/lib` directory for the core implementation of the project.
